# Garden Pi: Documentation

These pages serve to document the work done on GardenPi. The primary audience for these notes is the author (I don't really expect many to utilize this codebase), but it may be helpful to others as well.

This document is organized as follows:

* [Configuring the Raspberry Pi](RaspberryPi.md)
* [Electrical Configuraiton](Electrical.md)
* Configuring the Sensors
* Building/Configuring the Garden
* Configuring Water/Irrigation
* Putting it All Together

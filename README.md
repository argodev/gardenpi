# GardenPI

General Scripts supporting my indoor automated garden.

This will start off quite simple, and hopefully get a little more complex as we go on. As it stands currently, I have a RaspberryPi 3 B+ connected to a 4-port relay board that will control a lamp. There is also a camera installed that will take a picture once per day to help support a time-lapse view of the plants growing. I have a handful of sensors on the way and once they arrive, the system will begin to be more intelligent/automated.
